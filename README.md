So, this is my first time messing with react and three.js.
I just followed this tutorial by wrong akhim: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdtqqyeKRJk

I changed the colors, and it looks like the drei stuff is broken for now.
My goal was to build something with react-three-fiber to see if that was the direction I wanted to move; it is and so I'm off to bigger things.
